# About me
I am an assistant professor (non tenure track) at the University of Klagenfurt, working on symmetric convex optimization problems. I obtained my PhD from Tilburg University in 2022 as part of the [MINOA project](https://minoa-itn.fau.de/), under supervision of [Etienne de Klerk](https://sites.google.com/site/homepageetiennedeklerk/) and [Monique Laurent](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~monique/).


## Research interests
I study conic optimization for highly symmetric problems, investigating computational and analytical ways to exploit symmetries. In particular, I am interested in
* Semidefinite and polynomial optimization,
* Flag algebras and
* Energy minimization.
