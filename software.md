# Software
* [SDPSymmetryReduction.jl](https://github.com/DanielBrosch/SDPSymmetryReduction.jl): Given an SDP in standard form, exploit its symmetry using the Jordan reduction method.
* [FlagSOS.jl](https://github.com/DanielBrosch/FlagSOS.jl): Models flag sums-of-squares in various hierarchies and models, and exploits their symmetries.
