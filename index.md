# About me
I am a PhD-candidate in my final year at Tilburg University, working on symmetric convex optimization problems. My supervisors are [Etienne de Klerk](https://sites.google.com/site/homepageetiennedeklerk/) and [Monique Laurent](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~monique/). After obtaining my Masters degree in Mathematics at University of Cologne in 2018, I started my PhD the same year as part of the [MINOA project](https://minoa-itn.fau.de/).


## Research interests
I study conic optimization for highly symmetric problems, investigating computational and analytical ways to exploit symmetries. In particular I am interested in
* Semidefinite and polynomial optimization,
* Flag algebras and
* Energy minimization.

## News
Check out my recent slides from Oberwolfach on the [Symmetries of Flag-Algebras](https://slides.danielbrosch.com/FlagSymmetriesShort/).
